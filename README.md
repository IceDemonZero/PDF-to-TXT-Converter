# PDF-to-TXT-Converter
This is a program for automatically converting a PDF document (whether scanned or not) into a .txt file. For scanned documents, it makes use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) while documents containing readable text simply have that extracted.

## Prerequisites
You need to have both Poppler as well as PyTesseract installed. This is necessary for the OCR to work. Make sure the paths to both are specified in constants.py

## Installing
Just copy the program. The code is meant to work within another program so no GUI is provided. There is code to test it stored in main.py so give it a try!
